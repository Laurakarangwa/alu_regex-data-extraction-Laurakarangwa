This repository was created for my formative assignment on Regular Expressions (Regex).

## Regex Data Extraction Web App

This project is a simple **web application** that extracts specific data types from a large text using the Regular Expressions (Regex). It was developed as part of a regex data extraction assignment using Python or JavaScript, but I prefer to use JavaScript with the help of HTML, and CSS. It will be extracting 6 out of the 8 possible data extractions given.

## Features

The application can detect and extract the following types of data:

-  Email addresses  
-  URLs  
-  Phone numbers (various formats)  
-  Credit card numbers
-  Time (12/24hr)
-  HTML tags  

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** – Structure of the web page  
- **CSS** – Styling and layout  
- **JavaScript (Regex)** – Data extraction logic
